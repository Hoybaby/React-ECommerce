# React-ECommerce


Process

<p>In any react application, one must install react and I am first only doing the front end and then supporting it with Node.JS later. I will be using styled-components than vanilla css. I am using styled components because it can avoid conflicts between child components and styling. I first want to create and style components from left to right in the Navbar. Just like any React.Js application, a components folder will hold my styled components with the components themselves. I could combine the two files together but I want the component itself not to have any styling aspects to keep things simple and concise. When we are handing more logic based functions, it will get confusing. </p>
