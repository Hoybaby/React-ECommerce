<h1>Styling the Navbar, Annoucement </h1>

<p>In any react application, one must install react and I am first only doing the front end and then supporting it with Node.JS later. I will be using styled-components than vanilla css. I am using styled components because it can avoid conflicts between child components and styling. I first want to create and style components from left to right in the Navbar. Just like any React.Js application, a components folder will hold my styled components with the components themselves. I could combine the two files together but I want the component itself not to have any styling aspects to keep things simple and concise. When we are handing more logic based functions, it will get confusing. The styling is slow but tedious. In past projects, I let material-ui or Bootstrap handle most of the components but this time around, I wanted to practice my CSS and doing it from scatch.</p>
